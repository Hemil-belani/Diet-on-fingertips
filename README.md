# Diet-on-fingertips
Welcome to the Diet Tips and Suggestions project! This application provides personalized food recommendations based on user inputs such as age, BMI (Body Mass Index), and dietary preferences (vegetarian or non-vegetarian). The goal is to help users make healthier food choices by suggesting appropriate meals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
